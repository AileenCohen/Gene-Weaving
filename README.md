# Gene-Weaver
The Gene Weaver project designs TF experiments using a Uniprot ID. It retrieves domain, disorder, and motif data to automate primer design for isolation, truncation, deletion, and mutagenesis.  Features include codon optimization and rigorous Tm validation, creating lab-ready construct files.
